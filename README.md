This repository contains very old linux distributions, kernels, packages, and their sources. These files are scattered across the internet and are difficult to find. Nevertheless, they are quite important for academic and learning purposes.

***insmod*** in this directory is 1996 version of the program. Before Linux 2.4 insmod was responsible to symbol relocation in a kernel module, while it was being installed in the kernel. Therefore this code is important to understand how that was done.

***modutils*** folder is the corresponding modutils of that time.
