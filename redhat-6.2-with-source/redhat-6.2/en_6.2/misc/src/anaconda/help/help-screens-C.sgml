      <para>
	An upgrade will preserve existing &RHL; system data.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you want to perform a full installation, you must choose the class
	(or type) of the installation. Your options are: GNOME Workstation, KDE
	Workstation, Server, or Custom.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you are familiar with the <application>fdisk</application>
	partitioning tool, you may select it here.  If you do not choose to use
	<application>fdisk</application>, the installer will use the default
	partitioning tool, <application>Disk
	  Druid</application>. <application>Disk Druid</application> is a better
	choice if you do not have prior experience with
	<application>fdisk</application>.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you don't know which installation class you want, read the following
	very carefully.
      </para>
      <para>
	<command>Please note:</command> In addition to the installation methods
	mentioned below, &RHL; can also be installed "within" an already
	existing FAT (DOS/Windows) partition. This "partitionless" installation
	method is selected once you label a DOS partition as
	<command>/</command> during the <application>Disk Druid</application>
	partitioning screen. It overrides the automatic partition deletion used
	in workstation-class installations.
      </para>
      <para>
	Workstation-class installations will install the X Window System and the
	desktop manager of your choice. <emphasis>A workstation-class
	installation removes any Linux-related partitions on all installed hard
	drives (and uses all free unpartitioned disk space).</emphasis> All
	non-Linux-related partitions will be left untouched, and you will be
	able to boot other installed operating systems, in addition to &RHL;,
	after the installation.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you want your system to function as a Linux-based server, and you
	don't want to heavily customize your system configuration or install the
	X Window System, a server-class installation is most appropriate.
	<emphasis>A server-class installation removes ALL existing partitions on
	ALL installed hard drives, so choose this installation class only if
	  you're sure you have nothing you want saved!</emphasis> This includes
	ALL partitions in use by other operating systems. <emphasis>ALL drives
	  will be erased -- we're not kidding!</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
	Only the custom-class installation gives you complete
	flexibility. During a custom-class installation, it is up to
	<emphasis>you</emphasis> how disk space should be partitioned.  You have
	complete control over the packages that will be installed on your
	system.  You can also determine whether you'll use LILO to boot your
	system. Unless you have prior Linux experience, you should not select
	the custom-class installation method.

	LILO, the LInux LOader, is software that can be used to start &RHL; on

	<guibutton>Do not install LILO</guibutton>: You can choose to skip LILO
	if you do not want to write LILO to your drive. If you have two hard
	drives with a different OS on each drive, you may prefer to use a boot
	disk rather than LILO.
      </para>
      <para>
	To install LILO, select where you want to install it. If your system
	will use only &RHL; you should choose the Master Boot Record (MBR). For
	systems on which Win95/98 and &RHL; will reside on a single hard drive,
	you should also install LILO to the MBR.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you have Windows NT (and you want LILO to be installed) you should
	choose to install LILO on the first sector of the boot partition. Also,
	make sure to create a boot disk, otherwise you will not be able to boot
	into Linux.
      </para>

        SILO, the Sparc Improved LOader, is the software that can be
        used to start Red Hat Linux on your computer. It can also
        start other operating systems, such as SunOS and
        Solaris. Here, you'll be asked how (or whether) you want to
        configure SILO.
      </para>

        <guibutton>Create boot disk</guibutton>: You should create a
        boot disk if you are not installing SILO at all or if you want
        it for safety reasons.  If you don't have a floppy this option
        will be hidden, if you have a SMCC manufactured Ultra which
        usually don't have floppies which can be booted, this option
        will default to disabled.
      </para>
      <para>
        <guibutton>Do not install SILO</guibutton>: You can choose to
        skip SILO if you do not want to write SILO to your drive,
        e.g. if you have SILO already installed on a different
        partition or disk and want to boot from there.
      </para>
      <para>
        To install SILO, select where you want to install it. If your
        system will use only Red Hat Linux you should probably choose
        the Master Boot Record (Boot Block of the first partition on
        the disk). For systems where SunOS/Solaris and Red Hat Linux
        will reside on a single hard drive, you should probably not
        install SILO into the MBR, especially if SunOS/Solaris is on
        the first partition of the disk.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you choose not to install SILO for ANY reason, please make
        a boot disk so you can boot Red Hat Linux.

      <para>
        <guibutton>Create PROM alias</guibutton>: The installer can

        line by the command "boot linux".
