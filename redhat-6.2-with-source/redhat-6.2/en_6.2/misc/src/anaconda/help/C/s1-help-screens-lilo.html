	your computer. It can also start other operating systems, such as

	whether) you want to configure LILO.

CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Create boot disk</B
>: You should create a boot disk
	if you are not installing LILO on the MBR or if you are not installing
	LILO at all.
      </P
><P
>	<B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Do not install LILO</B
>: You can choose to skip LILO
	if you do not want to write LILO to your drive. If you have two hard
	drives with a different OS on each drive, you may prefer to use a boot
	disk rather than LILO.
      </P
><P
>	To install LILO, select where you want to install it. If your system
	will use only Red Hat Linux you should choose the Master Boot Record (MBR). For
	systems on which Win95/98 and Red Hat Linux will reside on a single hard drive,
	you should also install LILO to the MBR.
      </P
><P
>	If you have Windows NT (and you want LILO to be installed) you should
	choose to install LILO on the first sector of the boot partition. Also,
	make sure to create a boot disk, otherwise you will not be able to boot
	into Linux.
      </P
><P
>	If you choose not to install LILO for <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>any</I
> reason,
	please make a boot disk so you can boot Red Hat Linux.
      </P

>	If your computer does not access a hard drive in linear mode, deselect
	<B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Use linear mode</B
>.
      </P
><P
>	If you wish to add default options to the LILO boot command, enter them
	into the kernel parameters field.  Any options you enter will be passed
	to the Linux kernel every time it boots.

>: Every bootable partition is
	listed and labeled (under the <I

	listing at the bottom of the screen, including partitions used
	by other operating systems. If you would like to add boot
	labels for other partitions (or change existing boot labels),
	click once on the partition to select it. Once selected, you
	can change the boot label in the field above it.
