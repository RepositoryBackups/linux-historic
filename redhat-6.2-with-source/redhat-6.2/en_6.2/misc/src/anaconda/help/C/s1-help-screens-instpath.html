	selected partitions.
      </P
><P
>	An upgrade will preserve existing Red Hat Linux system data.
      </P
><P
>	If you want to perform a full installation, you must choose the class
	(or type) of the installation. Your options are: GNOME Workstation, KDE
	Workstation, Server, or Custom.
      </P
><P
>	If you are familiar with the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>fdisk</TT
>
	partitioning tool, you may select it here.  If you do not choose to use
	<TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>fdisk</TT
>, the installer will use the default
	partitioning tool, <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Disk
	  Druid</TT
>. <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Disk Druid</TT
> is a better
	choice if you do not have prior experience with
	<TT

> In addition to the installation methods
	mentioned below, Red Hat Linux can also be installed "within" an already
	existing FAT (DOS/Windows) partition. This "partitionless" installation
	method is selected once you label a DOS partition as
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>/</B
> during the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Disk Druid</TT
>
	partitioning screen. It overrides the automatic partition deletion used
	in workstation-class installations.
      </P
><P
>	Workstation-class installations will install the X Window System and the
	desktop manager of your choice. <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>A workstation-class
	installation removes any Linux-related partitions on all installed hard
	drives (and uses all free unpartitioned disk space).</I
> All
	non-Linux-related partitions will be left untouched, and you will be
	able to boot other installed operating systems, in addition to Red Hat Linux,
	after the installation.
      </P
><P
>	If you want your system to function as a Linux-based server, and you
	don't want to heavily customize your system configuration or install the
	X Window System, a server-class installation is most appropriate.
	<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>A server-class installation removes ALL existing partitions on
	ALL installed hard drives, so choose this installation class only if
	  you're sure you have nothing you want saved!</I
> This includes
	ALL partitions in use by other operating systems. <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>ALL drives
	  will be erased -- we're not kidding!</I
>
      </P
><P
>	Only the custom-class installation gives you complete
	flexibility. During a custom-class installation, it is up to
	<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>you</I
> how disk space should be partitioned.  You have
	complete control over the packages that will be installed on your
	system.  You can also determine whether you'll use LILO to boot your
	system. Unless you have prior Linux experience, you should not select
	the custom-class installation method.
      </P

>	For more information concerning the differences among workstation-,
	server-, and custom-class installations, please refer to the Red Hat Linux Installation Guide.
