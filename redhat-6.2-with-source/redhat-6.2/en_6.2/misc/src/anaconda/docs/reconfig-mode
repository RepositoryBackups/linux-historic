Reconfig mode
-------------

12/7/1999 Michael Fulbright

Reconfig mode is intended to allow localized customization of a pre-installed
Red Hat Linux box by the first time user of the machine.  Properties like
keyboard mapping, timezone, and network config are edittable the first
time the computer is booted.

Reconfig mode uses the same sources as the anaconda installer. When anaconda
is run in reconfig mode (using the --reconfig command line option) the
user is prompted for various configuration details.

The standard way of setting up anaconda for reconfig mode is to create
the file 

/etc/reconfigSys

as part of the installation process. This can easily be done as part of the 
kickstart procedure with a %post section at the end of the ks.cfg file:

%post
touch /etc/reconfigSys

The /etc/rc.d/init.d/reconfig init script is run and it tests for the
existence of the /etc/reconfigSys file. If it exists then anaconda is
run with the --reconfig option.

An alternate way to cause reconfig mode to be entered is to place the
kernel option 'reconfig' on the boot prompt command line for the kernel.
Using LILO for the boot loader, for example, one would start the 
standard linux image with:

LILO: linux reconfig

and the system would enter reconfigure mode.
