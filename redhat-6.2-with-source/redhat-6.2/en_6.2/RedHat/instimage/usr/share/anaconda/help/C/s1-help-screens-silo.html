><P
>        SILO, the Sparc Improved LOader, is the software that can be
        used to start Red Hat Linux on your computer. It can also
        start other operating systems, such as SunOS and
        Solaris. Here, you'll be asked how (or whether) you want to
        configure SILO.
      </P
><P
>        <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Create boot disk</B
>: You should create a
        boot disk if you are not installing SILO at all or if you want
        it for safety reasons.  If you don't have a floppy this option
        will be hidden, if you have a SMCC manufactured Ultra which
        usually don't have floppies which can be booted, this option
        will default to disabled.
      </P
><P
>        <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Do not install SILO</B
>: You can choose to
        skip SILO if you do not want to write SILO to your drive,
        e.g. if you have SILO already installed on a different
        partition or disk and want to boot from there.
      </P
><P
>        To install SILO, select where you want to install it. If your
        system will use only Red Hat Linux you should probably choose
        the Master Boot Record (Boot Block of the first partition on
        the disk). For systems where SunOS/Solaris and Red Hat Linux
        will reside on a single hard drive, you should probably not
        install SILO into the MBR, especially if SunOS/Solaris is on
        the first partition of the disk.
      </P
><P
>        If you choose not to install SILO for ANY reason, please make
        a boot disk so you can boot Red Hat Linux.
      </P
><P
>        <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Create PROM alias</B
>: The installer can
        create a PROM alias "linux" if the PROM supports it, so that
        you can boot into the SILO boot loader from the PROM command
        line by the command "boot linux".
      </P
><P
>        <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Set default PROM boot device</B
>: The
        installer can make sure the PROM will boot by default into the
        Red Hat Linux installer by setting PROM option "boot-device"
        or "boot-from".
      </P
><P
>       If you wish to add default options to the SILO boot command, enter them
       into the kernel parameters field.  Any options you enter will be passed
       to the Linux kernel every time it boots.
      </P
><P
>       Bootable Partition -- Every bootable partition is listed and labeled,
       including partitions used by other operating systems. If you would like
       to add boot labels for other partitions (or change existing boot
       labels), click once on the partition to select it. Once selected, you
       can change the boot label.
      </P
