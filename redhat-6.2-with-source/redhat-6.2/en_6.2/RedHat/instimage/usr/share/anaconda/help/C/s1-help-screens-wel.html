CLASS="COMMAND"
>New Feature:</B
> Red Hat Linux 6.2 has a new installation method
	known as a "partitionless" installation. If your system has a FAT
	(DOS/Windows) partition with sufficient free space, you can install
	Red Hat Linux without repartitioning your hard drive. This option is best suited
	for people who would like to try Red Hat Linux with a minimum of disruption to
	their current system.
      </P
><P
>	If you have purchased the Official Red Hat Linux boxed set, be sure to register
	your product through our website (www.redhat.com/now).
      </P
><P
>	Throughout this installation, you will be able to use your mouse to
	choose different options. You can also navigate the installation using
	the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Tab</B
> and <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Enter</B
> keys.
      </P
><P
>	Use the <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Next</B
> and <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Back</B
>
	buttons to progress through these screens. Click
	<B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Next</B
> to save the information and proceed to the
	next screen; click <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Back</B
> to move to the previous
	screen without saving any information.
      </P
><P
>	To minimize this help screen, click on the <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Hide
	  Help</B
> button.
      </P
><P
>	You can cancel this installation at any time up to the
	<B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Preparing to Install</B
> screen. Once you click
	<B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Next</B
> on <B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Preparing to Install</B
>,
	package installation will begin and data will be written to your hard
	drive. To cancel before this screen, you can safely reboot your system
	(use the <B
