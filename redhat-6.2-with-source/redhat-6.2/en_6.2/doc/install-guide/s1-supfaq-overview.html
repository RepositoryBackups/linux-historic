>      Red Hat provides installation assistance for Official Red Hat Linux boxed
      set products and covers installation on a single computer. This assistance
      is intended to help customers successfully install Red Hat Linux. Assistance with
      installation is offered via telephone and the Web.
    </P
><P
>      Red Hat Support will attempt to answer any questions you may have before the
      installation process is initiated. This includes the following:

        </P

      process:

          platforms only) to dual-boot using the Linux boot loader LILO. Please
          note that third party boot loaders and partitioning software are not
          supported.
        </P

>      Our installation assistance service is designed to get you up and running
      with Red Hat Linux as quickly and as easily as possible.  However, there are many
      other things that you may want to do with your Red Hat Linux system (from
      compiling a custom kernel to setting up a Web server) which are not
      covered.
    </P
><P
>      For assistance with these tasks, there is a wealth of on-line information
      available in the form of HOWTO documents, Linux-related websites, and
      commercial publications.  The Red Hat Linux operating system includes the various
      Linux HOWTO documents on the installation CD in the
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/doc/HOWTO</TT
> directory as plain text files that can
      easily be read from within Red Hat Linux and other operating systems.
    </P
><P
>      A large number of Linux-related websites are available.  The best starting
      point for finding information on Red Hat Linux is the Red Hat, Inc. website at:

      that covers Linux basics will be invaluable.  We can recommend several
      titles: <I

      configuration issues and tasks that are not covered by installation
      assistance.  Please see the Red Hat Support website for more information. The
