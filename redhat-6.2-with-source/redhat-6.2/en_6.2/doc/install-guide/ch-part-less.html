>Basic Installation</DT
><DD
><P
>	    You will perform a basic Red Hat Linux installation. However, instead of
	    adding Linux partitions to your system, you will edit an existing,
	    formatted DOS (FAT) partition (that must have enough free space) to be
	    named root (/).
	  </P
><P
>	    Unlike a typical Red Hat Linux installation, you will not need to format any
	    partitions, since you will not be adding any partitions to your
	    system.

>ader) and
	  Boot Disk</DT
><DD
><P
>	    In a partitionless installation, you will not configure LILO (the
	    LInux LOader). In a typical installation, you are able to choose
	    where you would like LILO to be installed -- either on the master
	    boot record (MBR) or on the first sector of your root partition --
	    or you can choose not to install LILO at all.
	  </P
><P
>	    You must create a boot disk in order to access Red Hat Linux with a
	    partitionless installation, and you will be prompted to create a boot
	    disk at the end of the installation. 
	  </P
></DD
><DT
>Performance Implications</DT
><DD
><P
>	    Red Hat Linux will perform slower than it would if it had its own dedicated
	    partitions. However, for those of you unconcerned with speed, a
	    partitionless installation is a great way of seeing what Red Hat Linux has
	    to offer without having to deal with partitioning your system.
