>        Each folder icon in the tree view at left represents a group of
        packages.  Each group can contain subgroups. Groups are used to place
        packages that perform similar functions in similar locations. For
        example, the folder <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Editors</B
> contains text
        editors such as <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>ed</TT
>,
        <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>vim</TT
> and
        <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GXedit</TT
>. From the tree view on the left, you
        might find another folder beneath <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Editors</B
>
        called <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Emacs</B
>, which would contain both
        <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>emacs</TT
> and
        <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>emacs-X11</TT
>.
      </P
><P
>        The tree view is also arranged in an expandable and collapsible manner,
        which helps you to easily navigate through the packages.  A folder which
        appears with a <B
CLASS="GUIICON"
>+</B
> next to it indicates that there
        are subfolders within that category.
      </P
><P
>        To view the packages and subgroups within a group, click once on a
        folder or a <B
CLASS="GUIICON"
>+</B
> with your left mouse button.  The
        display window will then show you the contents of that folder. By
        default, you will be presented with icons to represent the packages. You
        can change that view to a list view by selecting <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>View as
        list</B
> from the <B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Interface</B
> tab you'll find
        under <B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Operations</B
> =&#62; <B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Preferences</B
>.
        Refer to <A
HREF="s1-gnorpm-config.html"
>the section called <I
>Configuration</I
></A
> for more information about
        customizing the settings.
      </P
><P
>        In this manner, you can move about the tree view, opening and expanding
        folders containing applications, games, tools and more.  The contents of
        each folder will be displayed at the right.

          button. You'll notice that highlighting will appear around the package
          title (as shown in <A
HREF="s1-gnorpm-package-display.html#GR-GNORPM-GNOSELECT"
>Figure 7-2</A
>) which
          reflects the selection. To unselect it, either click on an empty space
          in the display panel with the left mouse button, or click on the
          <TT
CLASS="GUILABEL"
><B
>Unselect</B

          a package, the highlighting will disappear.

          in the tree panel. To select more than one package incrementally,
          left-click with your mouse button, while holding down the
          <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Ctrl</B

          additional selection.

          is, make larger selections within a folder, left-click one package,
          then, while holding down the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Shift</B
> key, left-click on
          the final package you wish to select. By doing so, you'll notice that
          individual packages between your starting and ending selections will
          also be highlighted for selection. Using this option makes selecting
          groups of packages quicker than selecting each package individually.
