            the more "tabs" you'll find within the <B

          information, you'll see a display area showing package files.
        </P
><P
>          In the left column in the information list, you'll find the size of
          the file, the machine on which the file is found, the name of the
          package distribution and the group to which its function belongs.
        </P
><P
>          In the right column, you'll find the date of the package's
          installation on your machine, the date the package was built, the name
          of the vendor and the name of the group who packaged the software. If
          the package has not been installed on your machine, that space will
          simply read, "not installed." Clicking on the name following
          <TT

          related column to the left of the path, that file is a documentation

            upgrade ensures that any changes you made to package configuration
            files are preserved properly, while uninstalling and then
            reinstalling a new package could cause those changes to be lost.

            error, reinstall the package after you've made more disk space
            available.
