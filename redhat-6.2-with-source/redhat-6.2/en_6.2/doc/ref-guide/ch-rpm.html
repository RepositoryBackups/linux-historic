>anager (RPM), is an open packaging system available
      for anyone to use, and works on Red Hat Linux as well as other Linux and UNIX
      systems. Red Hat, Inc. encourages other vendors to take the time to look at
      RPM and use it for their own products. RPM is distributable under the
      terms of the GPL.
    </P
><P
>      For the end user, RPM provides many features that make maintaining a
      system far easier than it has ever been. Installing, uninstalling, and
      upgrading RPM packages are all one line commands, and all the messy
      details have been taken care of for you. RPM maintains a database of
      installed packages and their files, which allows you to perform powerful
      queries and verification of your system.
    </P
><P
>      During upgrades, RPM handles configuration files specially, so that you
      never lose your customizations -- a feature that is impossible with
      straight <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.tar.gz</TT
> files.
    </P
><P
>      For the developer, RPM allows you to take source code for software and
      package it into source and binary packages for end users. This process is
      quite simple and is driven from a single file and optional patches that
      you create. This clear delineation of "pristine" sources and your patches
      and build instructions eases the maintenance of the package as new
      versions of the software are released.

>Upgradability</DT

><P
>              With RPM you can upgrade individual components of your system
              without completely reinstalling.  When you get a new release of an
              operating system based on RPM (such as Red Hat Linux), you don't need
              to reinstall on your machine (as you do with operating systems
              based on other packaging systems).  RPM allows intelligent,
              fully-automated, in-place upgrades of your system.  Configuration
              files in packages are preserved across upgrades, so you won't lose
              your customizations.
            </P

><DT
>Powerful Querying</DT
><DD
><P
>              RPM is also designed to have powerful querying options.  You can
              do searches through your entire database for packages or just
              certain files.  You can also easily find out what package a file
              belongs to and where it came from.  The files an RPM package
              contains are in a compressed archive, with a custom binary header
              containing useful information about the package and its contents,
              allowing you to query individual packages quickly and easily.
            </P
></DD
><DT
>System Verification</DT
><DD
><P
>              Another powerful feature is the ability to verify packages.  If
              you are worried that you deleted an important file for some
              package, simply verify the package.  You will be notified of any
              anomalies.  At that point, you can reinstall the package if
              necessary.  Any configuration files that you modified are
              preserved during reinstallation.
            </P
></DD
><DT
>Pristine Sources</DT
><DD
><P
>              A crucial design goal was to allow the use of "pristine" software
              sources, as distributed by the original authors of the software.
              With RPM, you have the pristine sources along with any patches
              that were used, plus complete build instructions.  This is a big
              advantage for several reasons.  For instance, if a new version of
              a program comes out, you don't necessarily have to start from
              scratch to get it to compile.  You can look at the patch to see
              what you <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>might</I
> need to do.  All the
              compiled-in defaults, and all of the changes that were made to get
              the software to build properly are easily visible this way.
            </P
><P
>              This goal may only seem important for developers, but it results
              in higher quality software for end users too.  We would like to
              thank the folks from the BOGUS distribution for originating the
              pristine source concept.
