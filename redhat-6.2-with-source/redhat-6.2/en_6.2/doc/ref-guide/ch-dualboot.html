	  You can install Red Hat Linux on your system without creating any Linux

	  installation. The installation program can install Red Hat Linux on an
	  existing, formatted Windows partition and you'll only need to create a
	  boot disk during the installation to access Red Hat Linux on your system.
	</P
><P
>	  This method is perfect for those who do not want to install Red Hat Linux as
	  the primary OS or as a dual-boot OS on your system. It is a great way
	  of trying out Red Hat Linux without creating Linux partitions on your system.

>	  Do you want to install Red Hat Linux and have the option of booting either
	  Red Hat Linux or your other operating system? Performing a workstation- or
	  custom-class installation will allow Red Hat Linux to install on your system
	  without affecting the other operating system. A workstation-class
	  installation will do this by default. In a custom-class installation,
	  you must install LILO (the LInux LOader) on the MBR (Master Boot
	  Record) -- unless Windows NT is your other OS or if you are already
	  using another boot loader on your system.  The
	  <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Official Red Hat Linux Installation Guide</I
> has instructions on installing and
	  configuring LILO.  After the installation, whenever you start the
	  computer, you will indicate whether you want to start Red Hat Linux or the
	  other operating system.
