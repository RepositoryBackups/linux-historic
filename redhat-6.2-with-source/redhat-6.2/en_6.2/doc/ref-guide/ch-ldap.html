>What is LDAP?</A
></H1
><P
>	LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a proposed open standard
	for global or local directory services over a network and/or the
	Internet.  A directory, in this sense, is very much like a phone book.
	LDAP can handle other information, but at present it is typically used
	to associate names with phone numbers and e-mail addresses. Directories
	are designed to support a high volume of queries, but the data in the
	directory doesn't change all that often.
      </P
><P
>	LDAP is much more useful than a paper phone book, because LDAP's design
	is intended to support propagation over LDAP servers throughout the
	Internet, much like the Domain Name Service (DNS). The DNS system acts
	as the address book of the Internet by keeping track of domain name/IP
	address pairs. DNS servers tell networked machines where packets need to
	go. In the future, LDAP could provide the same type of global access to
	many types of directory information: at present, LDAP is more commonly
	used within a single large organization, like a college or a company,
	for directory services.
      </P
><P
>	LDAP is a client-server system. An LDAP client connects to an LDAP
	server and either queries for information or provides information that
	needs to be entered into the directory. The server either answers the
	query, refers the query to another LDAP server, or accepts the
	information for incorporation into the directory.
      </P
><P
>	LDAP is sometimes known as <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>X.500 Lite</I
>. X.500 is
	an international standard for directories. X.500 is full-featured, but
	it is complex and requires lots of computing resources and the full OSI
	stack. LDAP, in contrast, can run easily on a PC and over TCP/IP. LDAP
	can access X.500 directories, but it does not support every capability
	of X.500.
