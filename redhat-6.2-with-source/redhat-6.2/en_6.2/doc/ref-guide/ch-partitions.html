>      Disk partitions are a standard part of the personal computer landscape,
      and have been for quite some time. However, with so many people purchasing
      computers featuring preinstalled operating systems, relatively few people
      understand how partitions work. This chapter attempts to explain how disk
      partitions work so you'll find your Red Hat Linux installation is as simple as
      possible.
  </P
><P
>    If you're reasonably comfortable with disk partitions, you could skip ahead
    to <A
HREF="ch-partitions.html#S2-PARTITIONS-MAKE-ROOM"
>the section called <I
>Making Room For Red Hat Linux</I
></A
> for more information on the
    process of freeing up disk space to prepare for a Red Hat Linux installation.  This
    section also discusses the partition naming scheme used by Linux systems,
    sharing disk space with other operating systems, and related topics.

>        When discussing issues such as disk partitioning, it's important to know
        a bit about the underlying hardware; unfortunately, it's easy to become
        bogged down in details. Therefore, let's use a simplified diagram of a
        disk drive to help us explain what goes on "under the hood."  <A

        basic level, it will do.  Let's say that we'd like to store some data on
        this drive.  As things stand now, it won't work.  There's something we
        need to do first&#8230;

          (usually known as "making a <I

          the empty space in an unformatted drive.

          as <A
HREF="ch-partitions.html#GR-PARTITIONS-OTHER-FORMATTED-D"
>Figure B-3</A
> shows, a disk
          drive may have one of many different filesystems written on it.  As
          you might guess, different filesystems tend to be incompatible; that
          is, an operating system that supports one filesystem (or a handful of
          related filesystem types) may not support another.  This last
          statement is not a hard-and-fast rule, however.  For example, Red Hat Linux
          supports a wide variety of filesystems (including many commonly used
          by other operating systems), making data interchange easy.

          how many files reside on this drive; it may be as few as one or as
          many as 14, as all files use at least one block.  Another important
          point to note is that the used blocks do not have to form a contiguous
          region; used and unused blocks may be interspersed.  This is known as

          change over time.  In particular, they changed in one specific way --
          they got bigger.  Not bigger in size, but bigger in capacity.  And it
          was this additional capacity that drove a change in the way disk
          drives were used.

>          As disk drive capacities soared, some people started wondering if
          having all that space in one big chunk wasn't such a great idea. This
          line of thinking was driven by several issues, some philosophical,
          some technical. On the philosophical side, above a certain size, it
          seemed that the additional space provided by a larger drive created
          more clutter. On the technical side, some filesystems were never
          designed to support larger drives. Or the filesystems

          if it was a separate disk. This is done through the addition of a

            start of the disk, before any filesystem or user data. But for
            clarity, we'll keep it separate in our diagrams.

          location on the disk. The "active" flag is used by some operating
          systems' boot loaders. In other words, the operating system in the
          partition that is marked "active" will be booted.
        </P
><P
>          The partition's type can be a bit confusing. The type is a number that
          identifies the partition's anticipated usage. If that statement sounds
          a bit vague, that's because the meaning of the partition type is a bit
          vague. Some operating systems use the partition type to denote a
          specific filesystem type, to flag the partition as being associated
          with a particular operating system, to indicate that the partition
          contains a bootable operating system, or some combination of the
          three.

>          Of course, in time it became obvious that four partitions would not be
          enough.  As disk drives continued to grow, it became more and more
          likely that a person could configure four reasonably-sized partitions
          and still have disk space left over.  There needed to be some way of
          creating more partitions.

            type; it is this partition type that is at the heart of extended
            partitions.  Here's how it works.
        </P

>          When a partition is created and its type is set to "Extended," an
          extended partition table is created. In essence, the extended
          partition is like a disk drive in its own right -- it has a partition
          table that points to one or more partitions (now called
          <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>logical partitions</I

          <I

          logical partitions -- there can only be four primary partitions, but
          there is no fixed limit to the number of logical partitions that can
          exist. (However, in reality it is probably not a good idea to try to
          define and use more than 12 logical partitions on a single disk
          drive.)

          how partitions are used and accessed by the Linux operating system.
          In DOS/Windows, it is relatively simple: If you have more than one
          partition, each partition gets a "drive letter."  You then use the
          drive letter to refer to files and directories on a given partition.
        </P
><P
>          This is entirely different from how Red Hat Linux deals with partitions and,
          for that matter, with disk storage in general.  The main difference is
          that each partition is used to form part of the storage necessary to
          support a single set of files and directories.  This is done by
          associating a partition with a directory through a process known as
          <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>mounting</I
>.  Mounting a partition makes its
          storage available starting at the specified directory (known as a
          <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>mount point</I
>).
        </P

>/usr</TT
>, that would mean that all files and
          directories under <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr</TT
> would physically reside on
          <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda5</TT

          <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/doc/FAQ/txt/Linux-FAQ</TT

CLASS="FILENAME"

          <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/X11/gdm/Sessions/Gnome</TT

          directories below <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr</TT

          other partitions.  For instance, a partition (say,
          <TT
