>          "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."  This old
          saying can be applied to learning about your Red Hat Linux system.  Learning
          to use a Linux system effectively can be a long, rewarding journey, in
          which you find that you can easily do things about which people with
          other operating systems can only dream. But like all journeys, you've
          got to start somewhere, and take that first step.

>              A brief history of Linux -- Many aspects of Linux are the way they
              are because of historical precedent.  There is also a Linux
              culture that, again, is based to a great deal on past history.  A
              bit of knowledge about the history of Linux will serve you well,
              particularly as you interact with more experienced Linux users on
              the Internet.

>              An explanation of how Linux works -- While it's not necessary to
              delve into the most arcane aspects of the Linux kernel, it's a
              good idea to know something about how Linux is put together.  This
              is particularly important if you've been working with other
              operating systems; some of the assumptions you hold about how
              computers work may not transfer from that operating system to
              Linux.  A few paragraphs that discuss how Linux works (and
              particularly how it differs from the operating system you're used
              to) can be invaluable in getting off to a good start with your
              Red Hat Linux system.

>              An introductory command overview (with examples) -- This is
              probably the most important thing to look for in Linux
              documentation.  The design philosophy behind Linux is that it's
              better to use many small commands connected together in different
              ways than it is to have a few large (and complex) commands that do
              the whole job themselves.  Without some examples that illustrate
              the Linux approach to doing things, you will find yourself
              intimidated by the sheer number of commands available on your
              Red Hat Linux system.

              not sure where to begin.  In this case, it's often a big help to
              see what others in similar circumstances have done.  This is where
              the Linux Documentation Project (also known as the LDP) can come
              in handy.  Each of their HOWTOs document a particular aspect of
              Linux, from low-level kernel esoterica, to using Linux for amateur
              radio station work.
