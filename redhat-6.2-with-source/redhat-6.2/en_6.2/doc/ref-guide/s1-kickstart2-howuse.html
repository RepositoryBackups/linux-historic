>      Kickstart installations can only be performed using a local CD-ROM, a
      local hard drive, or NFS installation methods.  FTP and HTTP installations
      cannot be automated using kickstart mode.
    </P
><P
>      To use kickstart mode, you must first create a kickstart file
      (<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ks.cfg</TT
>), and make it available to the Red Hat Linux
      installation program.

>	    on a boot disk
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	    on a network
	  </P
></LI

><P
>	Normally a kickstart file is copied to the boot disk, or made available
	on the network.  The network-based approach is most commonly used, as
	most kickstart installations tend to be performed on networked
	computers.  
      </P
><P
>	Let's take a more in-depth look at where the kickstart
	file may be placed.
      </P
><P
>	To perform a diskette-based kickstart installation, the kickstart file
	must be named <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ks.cfg</TT
>, and reside in the boot disk's
	top-level directory. Note that the Red Hat Linux boot disks are in MS-DOS
	format, making it easy to copy the kickstart file under Linux using the
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mcopy</B
> command:

	MS-DOS boot disk and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cp</B
> the file over. Although
	there's no technological requirement for it, most diskette-based
	kickstart installations install Red Hat Linux from a local CD-ROM.
      </P
><P
>	Network installations using kickstart are quite common, because system
	administrators can easily automate the installation on many networked
	computers quickly and painlessly.  In general, the approach most
	commonly used is for the administrator to have both a BOOTP/DHCP server
	and an NFS server on the local network.  The BOOTP/DHCP server is used
	to give the client system its networking information, while the actual
	files used during the installation are served by the NFS server.  Often,
	these two servers run on the same physical machine, but there is no
	requirement for this.
      </P
><P
>	To do a network-based kickstart installation, you must have a BOOTP/DHCP
	server on your network, and it must include configuration information
	for the machine on which you are attempting to install Red Hat Linux.  The BOOTP/DHCP
	server will be used to give the client its networking information as
	well as the location of the kickstart file.
      </P
><P
>	If a kickstart file is specified by the BOOTP/DHCP server, the client
	system will attempt an NFS mount of the file's path, and will copy the
	specified file to the client, using it as the kickstart file.  The exact
	settings required vary depending on the BOOTP/DHCP server you use.
      </P

CLASS="FILENAME"
>dhcpd.conf</TT

	file for the DHCP server shipped with Red Hat Linux:

	resides) and <TT

>next-server</TT

	name.
      </P
><P
>	If the filename returned by the BOOTP/DHCP server ends with a slash
	("/"), then it is interpreted as a path only.  In this case, the client
	system mounts that path using NFS, and searches for a specially-named
	file.  The filename the client searches for is:
