      disoriented when you want to accomplish your first tasks.
    </P
><P
>      Relax. If you've had any experience with other operating systems, learning
      Linux is a bit like learning to drive in a new country: Many of the ideas
      are the same, but some of the particulars are a bit different.
    </P

    </P

      without: the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>shell</I

      to the shell -- as in "shell prompt," or "bash."

        Ritchie and Ken Thompson were designing UNIX<sup
>TM</sup
>,
        they wanted to create a way that humans could interact with their new
        system.
      </P
><P
>        Operating systems at the time did come with <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>command
        interpreters</I
>, which could take commands from the user and
        interpret them so the machine could use them.
      </P
><P
>        But Ritchie and Thompson wanted something more, something which could
        offer better features than the command interpreters of the day.
      </P
><P
>        Enter the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>Bourne shell</I
> (known simply as
        <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>sh</I
>), created by S.R. Bourne, which fulfilled the
        goals of UNIX's creators.
      </P
><P
>        Since the creation of the Bourne shell, other shells have been
        developed, such as the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>C shell</I
>
        (<I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>csh</I
>) and the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>Korn shell</I
>
        (<I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>ksh</I
>).
      </P
><P
>        When the Free Software Foundation sought a royalty-free shell,
        developers began to work on the language behind the Bourne shell as well
        as some of the popular features from other shells available at the time.
      </P
><P
>        The result was the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>Bourne Again Shell</I
> -- or
        <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>bash</I
>.
      </P
><P
>        By now, of course, you've probably seen the word <TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>bash</TT
>
        when you've mistyped commands at the shell prompt (as in <TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>bash:
        somecommand: command not found</TT
>).
      </P
><P
>        In <A
HREF="ch-navigating.html"
>Chapter 13</A

        piping, we were also demonstrating the power of
        <TT

        office assistant who has made a habit of keeping notes on ways to
        fulfill commands quickly. This assistant also keeps "pointers" on how
        you like to customize the way you work.

        like a kitchen. We work in our kitchen, arrange pots, pans, and
        spices. We know where the dishes are, how things operate.
      </P
><P
>        The same can be said for <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>bash</TT

        environment. There's a basic arrangement to
        <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>bash</TT

        kitchen. For example, we'd expect to see pots in a kitchen in the same

        <TT
