>      GNOME is the default desktop environment in Red Hat Linux 6.2. Like KDE,
      GNOME is flexible and user-friendly, providing both the power of your new
      Red Hat Linux system and a comfortable graphical user interface -- or
      <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>GUI</I
>.
    </P
><P
>      This chapter will help you get acquainted with some of the fundamentals of
      GNOME. You'll find greater detail about specific tasks -- such as
      connecting a printer and setting up your Internet account -- in later
      chapters.
    </P

      website: <A
