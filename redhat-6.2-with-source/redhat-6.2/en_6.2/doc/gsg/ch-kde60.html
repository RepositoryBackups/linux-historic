      environment.
    </P
><P
>      Formally called the K Desktop Environment (the <I
CLASS="WORDASWORD"
>K</I
>
      doesn't represent any word, according to the website FAQ), the goals of
      the KDE Project are to lessen the Linux/UNIX learning curve for many
      users, and to present an appealing environment for everyone. Since its
      foundation in October 1996 by Matthias Ettrich, KDE has garnered praise
      from new and seasoned Linux users alike.
    </P
><P
>      Hundreds of free software developers from all over the world have worked
      on the KDE Project, and continue to refine and enhance the environment.
    </P
><P
>      Like the chapter about the basics of GNOME (<A
HREF="ch-gnome60.html"
>Chapter 2</A
>),
      this chapter will provide a quick overview of KDE fundamentals. Details,
      such as configuring your desktop, working with the file manager and using
      specific KDE tools, will be covered later in this book.
