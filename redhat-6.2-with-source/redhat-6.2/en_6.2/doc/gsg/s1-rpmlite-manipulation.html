	</P
><P

	  the file, the machine on which the file is found, the name of the
	  package distribution and the group to which its function belongs.
	</P
><P
>	  In the right column, you'll find the date of the package's
	  installation on your machine, the date the package was built, the name
	  of the vendor and the name of the group who packaged the software. If
	  the package has not been installed on your machine, that space will
	  simply read, "not installed."
	</P

	  package. If a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>D</B
> appears in its related column to
	  the left of the path, that file is a documentation file and would be a
	  good thing to read for help on using the application. If a
	  <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>C</B
> appears in its respective column, the file is a
	  configuration file. Under the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>S</B
> column, you can
	  view the "state" of the package; here, you'll receive information if
	  any files are reported as "missing" from the package (which probably
	  means there's a problem with the package).
	</P
><P
>	  If you're querying a package that's already installed, you'll also
	  find two additional buttons beneath at the bottom of this window:
	  <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Verify</B
> and <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"

	  you're performing a query on a package that hasn't been installed yet,

	  <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Upgrade</B
> and <B
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Check Sig</B

	  the <B

>X</B
