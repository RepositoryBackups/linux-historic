        Sure, Linus calls the shots where the kernel is concerned, but Linux is
        more than just the kernel.  There's no management infrastructure; a
        student in Russia gets a new motherboard, and writes a driver to support
        a neat feature the motherboard has.  A system administrator in Maryland
        needs backup software, writes it, and gives it away to anyone that needs
        it.  The right things just seem to happen at the right time.
      </P
><P
>        And Linux can be obtained for absolutely no money.  That's right: Most
        of the software is available (at no charge) to anyone with the time and
        inclination to download it.  But not everyone has that much time&#8230;

>          Enter a group of programmers based in North Carolina.  Their goal was
          to make it easier for people to give Linux a try.  Like many other
          such groups, their approach was to bundle all the necessary bits and
          pieces into a cohesive <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>distribution</I
>, relieving
          "newbies" from some of the more esoteric aspects of bootstrapping a
          new operating system on their PCs.
        </P
><P
>          However, unlike other distributions, this one was fundamentally
          different.  The difference?  Instead of being a snapshot of a hard
          disk that had a working copy of Linux on it, or a set of diskettes
          from which different parts of the operating system could be dumped,
          this distribution was based on <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>packages</I
>.
        </P
><P
>          Software development in the Linux world is fast-paced, so new versions
          of old software come out continually.  With other distributions,
          upgrading software was painful -- a complete upgrade usually meant
          deleting everything on your hard drive and starting over.
        </P
><P
>          Each package provided a different piece of software, fully tested,
          configured, and ready to run.  Want to try a new editor?  Download the
          package and install it.  In seconds, you can give it a try.  Don't
          like it?  Issue a single command, and the package is removed.
        </P
><P
>          If that was all there was to it, this distribution would be pretty
          nifty.  But being package-based meant there was one additional
          advantage:
        </P
><P
>          This Linux distribution could be easily upgraded.
        </P
><P
>          By now you've probably guessed that the group of programmers in North
          Carolina is Red Hat, and the package-based distribution is Red Hat Linux.
        </P
><P
>          Since Red Hat Linux's introduction in the summer of 1994, Linux and Red Hat have
          grown by leaps and bounds.  Much has changed; support for more
          esoteric hardware, huge increases in reliability, and the growing use
          of Linux by companies around the world.
        </P
><P
>          But much still remains the same.  Linux is still developed by people
          world-wide; Linus is still involved.  Red Hat is still headquartered in North
          Carolina; still trying to make Linux easier for people to use.
        </P
><P
>          And Red Hat Linux is still package-based; always has been, always will be.
        </P
><P
>          Since the release of version 4.0, Red Hat Linux runs on three leading
          computing platforms: Intel compatible PCs, Digital Alpha computers,
          and Sun SPARC
          
          
          equipment.  Our unified source tree and the benefits of RPM

          for each platform with a minimum of effort.  This, in turn, enables
          our users to manage and port software between these platforms as
          easily as possible.
        </P
><P
>          We make Red Hat Linux available by unrestricted FTP from our site and many
          mirror sites on the Internet.  Red Hat Linux is also available on CD-ROM.  For
          current information on our product offerings and links to other Linux
          resources please check Red Hat's website at <A

        </P

>          On most systems, Red Hat Linux is easy to install; the installation program
          can walk you through the process in as little as 15 minutes.  The
          system itself is very flexible.  With <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>RPM</TT
>,
          you can install and uninstall individual software packages with
          minimal effort.
        </P
><P
>          Because of <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>RPM</TT
>, Red Hat Linux is also easy to
          maintain -- package installations can be verified and corrected, and
          packages can be installed and uninstalled simply and reliably.
          Furthermore, Red Hat Linux is easy to administer.  Included are a rich set of
          administrative tools which reduce the hassle of everyday system
          administration. Complete source code is provided for the freely
          distributable components of the system.
