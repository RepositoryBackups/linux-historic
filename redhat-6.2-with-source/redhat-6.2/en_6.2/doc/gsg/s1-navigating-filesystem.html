        so that it can keep track of additions, modifications and other changes.
      </P
><P
>        In Linux, every file is stored on the system with a unique name, in
        directories which can also hold other files and directories -- or,
        subdirectories.
      </P
><P
>        You might think of the system as a tree-like structure, in which
        directories "branch off." Those directories may contain -- or be the
        "parent" of -- other directories which may hold files or directories of
        their own.
      </P
><P
>        There wouldn't be a tree without a root, and the same is true for the
        Linux filesystem. No matter how far away the branches, everything is
        connected to the root, which is represented as a single forward slash
        (/).

        account, the root account's login directory and the root directory
        (<TT

>), but think of it this way: The root login, who
        is the system administrator, is just as important to keeping things
        together in the system as the system's root (/).
