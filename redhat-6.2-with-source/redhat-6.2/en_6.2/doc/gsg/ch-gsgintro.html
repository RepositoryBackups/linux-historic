><P
>      Welcome to the <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Official Red Hat Linux Getting Started Guide</I
>!
    </P
><P
>      Just a few short years ago, a user who wanted to try out Linux had
      relatively few choices in the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>distributions</I
>, or
      types of packaged Linux operating systems, which were available. That's
      all changed. Now, there are dozens of Linux distributions from which you
      can choose.
    </P
><P
>      But Red Hat Linux has remained a leading choice of Linux distributions for
      years. Here at Red Hat, we believe we offer the best Linux distribution on
      the market. We hope you'll agree that the time and money you spent to
      install and work with Red Hat Linux were well spent, indeed.
    </P
><P
>      The <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Official Red Hat Linux Getting Started Guide</I
> is part of our effort to help you
      become acquainted with your new Red Hat Linux system.

></H1
><P
>	If you count yourself among the many who are discovering Red Hat Linux
	for the first time, this book is for you!
      </P
><P
>	Inside, you'll find valuable tips and tricks which can help you get
	acquainted with your desktop environment. Concentrating on tasks in
	GNOME and KDE, you'll see how to navigate through your system, how to
	manage files and directories and how to make some of the power of Red
	Hat Linux work for you.
      </P
><P
>	If you're most familiar with a Windows environment, you'll find the
	DOS-to-Linux commands in <A
HREF="ch-doslinux.html"
>Appendix C</A
> (as well as the
	tips on the enclosed "cheat sheet" in the boxed set of Red Hat Linux)
	to be useful guides, so you can start looking around right away.

>	You'll learn how to accomplish such basic first steps as connecting to
	the Internet, configuring your e-mail client, adding a printer and more.
      </P
><P
>	More advanced topics will cover how to work with <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Update
	Agent</TT
>, so your system automatically stays current with
	critical software updates.
      </P
><P
>	Is Red Hat Linux sharing your computer with Microsoft Windows? Turn to <A
HREF="ch-q-and-a.html"
>Chapter 15</A
> to find out how you can allow Red Hat Linux to "see" into
	your other operating system, so you can perform certain tasks without
	having to reboot into the other operating system.
      </P
><P
>	You'll even gain some experience at file management and system
	administration using the "shell prompt," the command-line interface.
      </P
><P
>	In short, this guide picks up where the <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Official Red Hat Linux Installation Guide</I
>
	leaves off: by giving you the confidence to work with your new operating
	system.
