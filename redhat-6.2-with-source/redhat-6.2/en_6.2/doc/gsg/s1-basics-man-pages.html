><P
>	As you investigate your new system, you're bound to have questions about
	commands and system services. One of the easiest ways to find out about
	how to use many commands or some applications is through the
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>man</B
> command.
      </P
><P
>	The word <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>man</B
> stands for "manual," a series of online
	"pages" which can tell you the purpose of many commands. In a highly
	condensed format, man pages provide a summary of a command's purpose,
	the options available and the syntax which is used to issue the command.
      </P
><P
>	If you count yourself among the "newbies" to Linux, you might not find
	man pages as useful as someone who's more accustomed to their terse
	delivery of information. But man pages can help steer you toward the
	proper way to use commands on your system. Even at this point, you can
	gain insight into your system by familiarizing yourself with the man
	pages. You'll certainly want to know how to use them eventually.
      </P
><P
>	There are several ways to view the man pages in a graphical
	presentation:
      </P

><P
>	Sometimes, just viewing the man page on the screen isn't enough; you may
	want to have a printed copy in front of you. Although you could send the
	page to a printer, because of certain text formatting in the man pages,
	you could end up with a document filled with "garbage," symbols which
	didn't translate from your screen to the printer.
      </P
><P
>	Before you print, then, you may have to "strip" the formatting from the
	page, which you can do with the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>col</B
> command. (As you
	might guess, there's a man page for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>col</B
>, also.)
      </P

CLASS="COMMAND"
>man</B

><P
>	In detail, the above command "sends" the output of the manual page entry
	through the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>col</B
> filter, which helps format the output for
	the printer. Then, the output from <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>col</B
