>      Normally, <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>PPP</I
> accounts are used to dial in to an
      Internet Service Provider (<I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>ISP</I
>). Using PPP, which
      stands for <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>Point-to-Point Protocol</I
>, you connect to
      a large network (the Internet) through your ISP; your machine becomes a
      part of that network and you use the resources of
      the network. 
      </P
><P
>      Both GNOME and KDE offer useful tools for establishing and modifying PPP
      accounts to ISPs. These utilities remove much of the guesswork in creating
      an online connection; in many cases, your only requirement is a valid
      Internet account.
    </P
><P
>      The utilities -- <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>RP3</TT
> for
      GNOME and <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Kppp</TT
> for KDE -- can be
      interchangeable, too. You can use <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>RP3</TT
> to set up
      and connect in KDE; similarly, you can use <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Kppp</TT
>
      if you're using GNOME. 
    </P
><P
>      If you use <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>RP3</TT
> or
      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Kppp</TT
> outside of their respective environments,
      however, you will lose the ability to <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>dock</I
> the
      running applications. That means you won't be able to integrate
      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>RP3</TT
> into the KDE <B
CLASS="GUIMENU"

>, for
      example -- or <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Kppp</TT
> in the GNOME
      <B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Panel</B
>. When they're docked on their
      <B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Panels</B
>, both utilities provide information about your
      connection, such as connection time, speed of the connection and more. You
      will be able to <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>minimize</I
> these utilities on the
      <B
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Panel</B
>, however.
    </P
><P
>      Note, also, that if you create an account in GNOME with
      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>RP3</TT
>, but would rather use
      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Kppp</TT
>, you'll have to set up your account again
      in that application; in other words, information you enter in one
      application won't be available to the other application.
